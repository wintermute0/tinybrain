    Individual Contributor License Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) V2.0
             http://www.scalablesolutions.se/licenses/

Thank you for your interest in Akka, a Typesafe Inc. (the
&quot;Company&quot;) Open Source project. In order to clarify the intellectual
property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity,
the Company must have a Contributor License Agreement (&quot;CLA&quot;) on file
that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the
license terms below. This license is for your protection as a
Contributor as well as the protection of the Company and its users;
it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any
other purpose.

  Full name: ______________________________________________________

  Mailing Address: ________________________________________________

  _________________________________________________________________

  _________________________________________________________________

  Country:   ______________________________________________________

  Telephone: ______________________________________________________

  Facsimile: ______________________________________________________

  E-Mail:    ______________________________________________________

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
present and future Contributions submitted to the Company. In
return, the Company shall not use Your Contributions in a way that
is contrary to the public benefit or inconsistent with its nonprofit
status and bylaws in effect at the time of the Contribution. Except
for the license granted herein to the Company and recipients of
software distributed by the Company, You reserve all right, title,
and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. Definitions.

   &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
   authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement
   with the Company. For legal entities, the entity making a
   Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled
   by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to
   be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
   &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any original work of authorship,
   including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
   is intentionally submitted by You to the Company for inclusion
   in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by
   the Company (the &quot;Work&quot;). For the purposes of this definition,
   &quot;submitted&quot; means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
   communication sent to the Company or its representatives,
   including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
   lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
   are managed by, or on behalf of, the Company for the purpose of
   discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that
   is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You
   as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Company and to
   recipients of software distributed by the Company a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
   Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Company and to
   recipients of software distributed by the Company a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
   made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
   Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
   licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any
   entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
   that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed,
   constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
   patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for
   that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

4. You agree that all Contributions are and will be given entirely
   voluntarily. Company will not be required to use, or to refrain
   from using, any Contributions that You, will not, absent a
   separate written agreement signed by Company, create any
   confidentiality obligation of Company, and Company has not
   undertaken any obligation to treat any Contributions or other
   information You have given Company or will give Company in the
   future as confidential or proprietary information. Furthermore,
   except as otherwise provided in a separate subsequence written
   agreement between You and Company, Company will be free to use,
   disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise distribute, and exploit
   the Contributions as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or
   restriction of any kind on account of any proprietary or
   intellectual property rights or otherwise.

5. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
   license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property
   that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent
   that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf
   of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for
   your Contributions to the Company, or that your employer has
   executed a separate Corporate CLA with the Company.

6. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
   creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).  You
   represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete
   details of any third-party license or other restriction (including,
   but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you
   are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
   Contributions.

7. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
   except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
   support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
   applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
   Contributions on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
   OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
   limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
   INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

8. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
   You may submit it to the Company separately from any
   Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of
   any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
   related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you
   are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as
   &quot;Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]&quot;.

9. You agree to notify the Company of any facts or circumstances of
   which you become aware that would make these representations
   inaccurate in any respect.

9. The validity of the interpretation of this Agreements shall be
   governed by, and constructed and enforced in accordance with, the
   laws of Sweden, applicable to the agreements made there (excluding
   the conflict of law rules). This Agreement embodies the entire
   agreement and understanding of the parties hereto and supersedes
   any and all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings
   relating to the matters provided for herein. No alteration, waiver,
   amendment changed or supplement hereto shall be binding more
   effective unless the same as set forth in writing signed by both
   parties.
