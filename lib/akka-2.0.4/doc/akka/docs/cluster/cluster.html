<div class="section" id="intro">
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Akka Cluster provides a fault-tolerant, elastic, decentralized peer-to-peer
cluster with no single point of failure (SPOF) or single point of bottleneck
(SPOB). It implements a Dynamo-style system using gossip protocols, automatic
failure detection, automatic partitioning, handoff, and cluster rebalancing. But
with some differences due to the fact that it is not just managing passive data,
but actors - active, sometimes stateful, components that also have requirements
on message ordering, the number of active instances in the cluster, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="terms">

</div>
<div class="section" id="membership">
<h2>Membership</h2>
<p>A cluster is made up of a set of member nodes. The identifier for each node is a
<cite>hostname:port</cite> pair. An Akka application is distributed over a cluster with
each node hosting some part of the application. Cluster membership and
partitioning of the application are decoupled. A node could be a member of a
cluster without hosting any actors.</p>
<div class="section" id="gossip">
<h3>Gossip</h3>
<p>The cluster membership used in Akka is based on Amazon's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Dynamo</a> system and
particularly the approach taken in Basho's' <a class="reference external" href="http://basho.com/technology/architecture/">Riak</a> distributed database.
Cluster membership is communicated using a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol">Gossip Protocol</a>, where the current
state of the cluster is gossiped randomly through the cluster. Joining a cluster
is initiated by specifying a set of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed</span></tt> nodes with which to begin
gossiping.</p>
<div class="section" id="vector-clocks">
<h4>Vector Clocks</h4>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock">Vector clocks</a> are an algorithm for generating a partial ordering of events in
a distributed system and detecting causality violations.</p>
<p>We use vector clocks to to reconcile and merge differences in cluster state
during gossiping. A vector clock is a set of (node, counter) pairs. Each update
to the cluster state has an accompanying update to the vector clock.</p>
<p>One problem with vector clocks is that their history can over time be very long,
which will both make comparisons take longer time as well as take up unnecessary
memory. To solve that problem we do pruning of the vector clocks according to
the <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.basho.com/Vector-Clocks.html#Vector-Clock-Pruning">pruning algorithm</a> in Riak.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gossip-convergence">
<h4>Gossip convergence</h4>
<p>Information about the cluster converges at certain points of time. This is when
all nodes have seen the same cluster state. Convergence is recognised by passing
a map from node to current state version during gossip. This information is
referred to as the gossip overview. When all versions in the overview are equal
there is convergence. Gossip convergence cannot occur while any nodes are
unreachable, either the nodes become reachable again, or the nodes need to be
moved into the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">removed</span></tt> states (see section on <a class="reference internal" href="#member-states">Member states</a>
below).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="failure-detector">
<h4>Failure Detector</h4>
<p>The failure detector is responsible for trying to detect if a node is
unreachable from the rest of the cluster. For this we are using an
implementation of <a class="reference external" href="http://ddg.jaist.ac.jp/pub/HDY+04.pdf">The Phi Accrual Failure Detector</a> by Hayashibara et al.</p>
<p>An accrual failure detector decouple monitoring and interpretation. That makes
them applicable to a wider area of scenarios and more adequate to build generic
failure detection services. The idea is that it is keeping a history of failure
statistics, calculated from heartbeats received from the gossip protocol, and is
trying to do educated guesses by taking multiple factors, and how they
accumulate over time, into account in order to come up with a better guess if a
specific node is up or down. Rather than just answering &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to the
question &quot;is the node down?&quot; it returns a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phi</span></tt> value representing the
likelihood that the node is down.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threshold</span></tt> that is the basis for the calculation is configurable by the
user. A low <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threshold</span></tt> is prone to generate many wrong suspicions but ensures
a quick detection in the event of a real crash. Conversely, a high <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threshold</span></tt>
generates fewer mistakes but needs more time to detect actual crashes. The
default <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">threshold</span></tt> is 8 and is appropriate for most situations. However in
cloud environments, such as Amazon EC2, the value could be increased to 12 in
order to account for network issues that sometimes occur on such platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="leader">
<h4>Leader</h4>
<p>After gossip convergence a leader for the cluster can be determined. There is no
leader election process, the leader can always be recognised deterministically
by any node whenever there is gossip convergence. The leader is simply the first
node in sorted order that is able to take the leadership role, where the only
allowed member states for a leader are <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">up</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leaving</span></tt> (see below for more
information about member states).</p>
<p>The role of the leader is to shift members in and out of the cluster, changing
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">joining</span></tt> members to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">up</span></tt> state or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">exiting</span></tt> members to the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">removed</span></tt> state, and to schedule rebalancing across the cluster. Currently
leader actions are only triggered by receiving a new cluster state with gossip
convergence but it may also be possible for the user to explicitly rebalance the
cluster by specifying migrations, or to rebalance the cluster automatically
based on metrics from member nodes. Metrics may be spread using the gossip
protocol or possibly more efficiently using a <em>random chord</em> method, where the
leader contacts several random nodes around the cluster ring and each contacted
node gathers information from their immediate neighbours, giving a random
sampling of load information.</p>
<p>The leader also has the power, if configured so, to &quot;auto-down&quot; a node that
according to the Failure Detector is considered unreachable. This means setting
the unreachable node status to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></tt> automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h4>Gossip protocol</h4>
<p>A variation of <em>push-pull gossip</em> is used to reduce the amount of gossip
information sent around the cluster. In push-pull gossip a digest is sent
representing current versions but not actual values; the recipient of the gossip
can then send back any values for which it has newer versions and also request
values for which it has outdated versions. Akka uses a single shared state with
a vector clock for versioning, so the variant of push-pull gossip used in Akka
makes use of the gossip overview (containing the current state versions for all
nodes) to only push the actual state as needed. This also allows any node to
easily determine which other nodes have newer or older information, not just the
nodes involved in a gossip exchange.</p>
<p>Periodically, the default is every 1 second, each node chooses another random
node to initiate a round of gossip with. The choice of node is random but can
also include extra gossiping for unreachable nodes, seed nodes, and nodes with
either newer or older state versions.</p>
<p>The gossip overview contains the current state version for all nodes and also a
list of unreachable nodes. Whenever a node receives a gossip overview it updates
the <a class="reference internal" href="#failure-detector">Failure Detector</a> with the liveness information.</p>
<p>The nodes defined as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed</span></tt> nodes are just regular member nodes whose only
&quot;special role&quot; is to function as contact points in the cluster and to help
breaking logical partitions as seen in the gossip algorithm defined below.</p>
<p>During each round of gossip exchange the following process is used:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Gossip to random live node (if any)</li>
<li>Gossip to random unreachable node with certain probability depending on the
number of unreachable and live nodes</li>
<li>If the node gossiped to at (1) was not a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed</span></tt> node, or the number of live
nodes is less than number of seeds, gossip to random <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">seed</span></tt> node with
certain probability depending on number of unreachable, seed, and live nodes.</li>
<li>Gossip to random node with newer or older state information, based on the
current gossip overview, with some probability (?)</li>
</ol>
<p>The gossiper only sends the gossip overview to the chosen node. The recipient of
the gossip can use the gossip overview to determine whether:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>it has a newer version of the gossip state, in which case it sends that back
to the gossiper, or</li>
<li>it has an outdated version of the state, in which case the recipient requests
the current state from the gossiper</li>
</ol>
<p>If the recipient and the gossip have the same version then the gossip state is
not sent or requested.</p>
<p>The main structures used in gossiping are the gossip overview and the gossip
state:</p>

<h3>Membership lifecycle</h3>
<p>A node begins in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">joining</span></tt> state. Once all nodes have seen that the new
node is joining (through gossip convergence) the leader will set the member
state to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">up</span></tt> and can start assigning partitions to the new node.</p>
<p>If a node is leaving the cluster in a safe, expected manner then it switches to
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">leaving</span></tt> state. The leader will reassign partitions across the cluster
(it is possible for a leaving node to itself be the leader). When all partition
handoff has completed then the node will change to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">exiting</span></tt> state. Once
all nodes have seen the exiting state (convergence) the leader will remove the
node from the cluster, marking it as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">removed</span></tt>.</p>
<p>A node can also be removed forcefully by moving it directly to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">removed</span></tt>
state using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">remove</span></tt> action. The cluster will rebalance based on the new
cluster membership.</p>
<p>If a node is unreachable then gossip convergence is not possible and therefore
any leader actions are also not possible (for instance, allowing a node to
become a part of the cluster, or changing actor distribution). To be able to
move forward the state of the unreachable nodes must be changed. If the
unreachable node is experiencing only transient difficulties then it can be
explicitly marked as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></tt> using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">down</span></tt> user action. When this node
comes back up and begins gossiping it will automatically go through the joining
process again. If the unreachable node will be permanently down then it can be
removed from the cluster directly with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">remove</span></tt> user action. The cluster
can also <em>auto-down</em> a node using the accrual failure detector.</p>
<p>This means that nodes can join and leave the cluster at any point in time,
e.g. provide cluster elasticity.</p>

<div class="section" id="partitioning">
<h2>Partitioning</h2>
<p>Each partition (an actor or actor subtree) in the actor system is assigned to a
set of nodes in the cluster. The actor at the head of the partition is referred
to as the partition point. The mapping from partition path (actor address of the
format &quot;a/b/c&quot;) to instance nodes is stored in the partition table and is
maintained as part of the cluster state through the gossip protocol. The
partition table is only updated by the leader node. Currently the only possible
partition points are <em>routed</em> actors.</p>
<p>Routed actors can have an instance count greater than one. The instance count is
also referred to as the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N-value</span></tt>. If the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N-value</span></tt> is greater than one then
a set of instance nodes will be given in the partition table.</p>
<p>Note that in the first implementation there may be a restriction such that only
top-level partitions are possible (the highest possible partition points are
used and sub-partitioning is not allowed). Still to be explored in more detail.</p>
<p>The cluster leader determines the current instance count for a partition based
on two axes: fault-tolerance and scaling.</p>
<p>Fault-tolerance determines a minimum number of instances for a routed actor
(allowing N-1 nodes to crash while still maintaining at least one running actor
instance). The user can specify a function from current number of nodes to the
number of acceptable node failures: n: Int =&gt; f: Int where f &lt; n.</p>
<p>Scaling reflects the number of instances needed to maintain good throughput and
is influenced by metrics from the system, particularly a history of mailbox
size, CPU load, and GC percentages. It may also be possible to accept scaling
hints from the user that indicate expected load.</p>
<p>The balancing of partitions can be determined in a very simple way in the first
implementation, where the overlap of partitions is minimized. Partitions are
spread over the cluster ring in a circular fashion, with each instance node in
the first available space. For example, given a cluster with ten nodes and three
partitions, A, B, and C, having N-values of 4, 3, and 5; partition A would have
instances on nodes 1-4; partition B would have instances on nodes 5-7; partition
C would have instances on nodes 8-10 and 1-2. The only overlap is on nodes 1 and
2.</p>
<p>The distribution of partitions is not limited, however, to having instances on
adjacent nodes in the sorted ring order. Each instance can be assigned to any
node and the more advanced load balancing algorithms will make use of this. The
partition table contains a mapping from path to instance nodes. The partitioning
for the above example would be:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="n">B</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">6</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span> <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="n">C</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If 5 new nodes join the cluster and in sorted order these nodes appear after the
current nodes 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, then the partition table could be updated to
the following, with all instances on the same physical nodes as before:</p>
<div class="highlight-scala"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="n">B</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span> <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="n">C</span> <span class="o">-&gt;</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="mi">12</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When rebalancing is required the leader will schedule handoffs, gossiping a set
of pending changes, and when each change is complete the leader will update the
partition table.</p>
<div class="section" id="handoff">
<h3>Handoff</h3>
<p>Handoff for an actor-based system is different than for a data-based system. The
most important point is that message ordering (from a given node to a given
actor instance) may need to be maintained. If an actor is a singleton actor
(only one instance possible throughout the cluster) then the cluster may also
need to assure that there is only one such actor active at any one time. Both of
these situations can be handled by forwarding and buffering messages during
transitions.</p>
<p>A <em>graceful handoff</em> (one where the previous host node is up and running during
the handoff), given a previous host node <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt>, a new host node <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt>, and an
actor partition <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> to be migrated from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt>, has this general
structure:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the leader sets a pending change for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> to handoff <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> notices the pending change and sends an initialization message to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt></li>
<li>in response <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt> creates <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> and sends back a ready message</li>
<li>after receiving the ready message <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> marks the change as
complete and shuts down <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt></li>
<li>the leader sees the migration is complete and updates the partition table</li>
<li>all nodes eventually see the new partitioning and use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt></li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<div class="section" id="transitions">
<h4>Transitions</h4>
<p>There are transition times in the handoff process where different approaches can
be used to give different guarantees.</p>
<div class="section" id="migration-transition">
<h5>Migration transition</h5>
<p>The first transition starts when <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> initiates the moving of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> and ends
when <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> receives the ready message, and is referred to as the <em>migration
transition</em>.</p>
<p>The first question is; during the migration transition, should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> continue to process messages for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>?</li>
<li>Or is it important that no messages for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> are processed on
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> once migration begins?</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is okay for the previous host node <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> to process messages during
migration then there is nothing that needs to be done at this point.</p>
<p>If no messages are to be processed on the previous host node during migration
then there are two possibilities: the messages are forwarded to the new host and
buffered until the actor is ready, or the messages are simply dropped by
terminating the actor and allowing the normal dead letter process to be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="update-transition">
<h5>Update transition</h5>
<p>The second transition begins when the migration is marked as complete and ends
when all nodes have the updated partition table (when all nodes will use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt>
as the host for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>, i.e. we have convergence) and is referred to as the
<em>update transition</em>.</p>
<p>Once the update transition begins <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> can forward any messages it receives
for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> to the new host <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt>. The question is whether or not message
ordering needs to be preserved. If messages sent to the previous host node
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> are being forwarded, then it is possible that a message sent to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt>
could be forwarded after a direct message to the new host <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt>, breaking
message ordering from a client to actor <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>.</p>
<p>In this situation <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt> can keep a buffer for messages per sending node. Each
buffer is flushed and removed when an acknowledgement (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ack</span></tt>) message has been
received. When each node in the cluster sees the partition update it first sends
an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ack</span></tt> message to the previous host node <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> before beginning to use
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt> as the new host for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>. Any messages sent from the client node
directly to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt> will be buffered. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> can count down the number of acks to
determine when no more forwarding is needed. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ack</span></tt> message from any node
will always follow any other messages sent to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt>. When <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> receives the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ack</span></tt> message it also forwards it to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt> and again this <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ack</span></tt> message
will follow any other messages already forwarded for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>. When <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt> receives
an <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ack</span></tt> message, the buffer for the sending node can be flushed and removed.
Any subsequent messages from this sending node can be queued normally. Once all
nodes in the cluster have acknowledged the partition change and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt> has
cleared all buffers, the handoff is complete and message ordering has been
preserved. In practice the buffers should remain small as it is only those
messages sent directly to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N2</span></tt> before the acknowledgement has been forwarded
that will be buffered.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>The default approach is to take options 2a, 3a, and 4a - allowing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> on
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">N1</span></tt> to continue processing messages during migration and then forwarding any
messages during the update transition. This assumes stateless actors that do not
have a dependency on message ordering from any given source.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If an actor has a distributed durable mailbox then nothing needs to be done,
other than migrating the actor.</li>
<li>If message ordering needs to be maintained during the update transition then
option 3b can be used, creating buffers per sending node.</li>
<li>If the actors are robust to message send failures then the dropping messages
approach can be used (with no forwarding or buffering needed).</li>
<li>If an actor is a singleton (only one instance possible throughout the cluster)
and state is transferred during the migration initialization, then options 2b
and 3b would be required.</li>

<p>Support for stateful singleton actors will come in future releases of Akka, and
is scheduled for Akka 2.2. Having a Dynamo base for the clustering already we

distributed datastore. See the next section for a rough outline on how the
